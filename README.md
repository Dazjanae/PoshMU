Project Title
Posh Makeup Studio

Description
This is a static website which allows viewing of this business' details such as an "about me" section, how to schedule an appointment, and view the gallery of their previous work. For this project, HTML was used to add needed content and details for the customer/viewer, CSS was used to make this site visually appealing, and a tad of Javascript was used to create a gallery that can change photos from a simple click. In the future, I wish to change the responsiveness of the site. It is already responsive, however there are a few additional changes I would wish to go back anad make , just for better visual experience.
